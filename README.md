All the modules were updated to Swift 4 and most of them won't compile with Swift 3.<br/>
Please use the latest [Swift 4 Snapshot](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots).<br/><br/>
You can also use `trisdocker/universe:dev` docker image, it should work for all our modules.

If you can't use Swift 4 for some reason, we have 3.1 branch.
